‚ö†Ô∏è GMAIL SENDING WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

You're about to send {total_recipients} emails.

üö´ Gmail Safe Limits:
  - 100 to 150 emails/day on a normal Gmail account
  - No more than 20 to 30 in short intervals
  - Using too many threads may trigger spam filters

üí• Risks of Violating Limits:
  - Account suspension or temp lock
  - Deliverability damage (emails marked as spam)
  - Delayed or bounced messages

‚úÖ Safe Usage Tips:
  - Use up to {MAX_THREADS} threads max
  - Send 20 to 30 emails per batch
  - Let the tool handle delays between sends
